<h2>Pre-Workout Tips</h2>

<p>Preparing your body properly before a workout can help you maximize performance, prevent injury, and get the most out of your exercise session. Here are some pre-workout tips to help you prepare effectively:</p>

<h3>1. Hydration</h3>
<p>Drink plenty of water before your workout to stay hydrated and maintain optimal performance. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, cramps, and decreased exercise capacity.</p>

<h3>2. Nutrition</h3>
<p>Consume a balanced meal or snack containing carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats about 1-2 hours before your workout. This will provide your body with the energy and nutrients it needs to perform at its best. <a href="@("/nutrition")">Learn more about nutrition.</a></p>

<h3>5. Proper Gear</h3>
<p>Wear appropriate workout attire and footwear that provide support, comfort, and stability for your chosen activity. This will help optimize performance and reduce the risk of injury.</p>
